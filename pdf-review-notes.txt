   - Report ID: mjrq7r5ibipq9a34kjo

ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS:
----------------------
The photos are stored as local file:// URIs (device paths) which cannot be 
embedded in the PDF. Only the property cover photo and the one "Outdoor Areas" 
photo seem to have valid URLs. The PDF generator needs cloud URLs (https://) 
to embed photos properly.
